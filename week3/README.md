# Week 3 README

## Project Structure and Usage: 
**Please remember to run these shell scripts in code directory.**
### Code
- DataWrang.R: Wrangling the Pound Hill Dataset
- R_conditionals.R: some examples of functions with conditionals
- Ricker.R: a script shows Ricker model which is a classic discrete population model
- TreeHeight.R: This script reads a csv file containing trees' species, distance and angle, calculates all of the trees' height, then append heights to the origin csv file as a new csv file stored in ../result
- Vectorize1.R: an example illustrating that vectorization can optimize code computational efficiency and make code more concise, easy to read, less prone
- Vectorize2.R: Runs the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations in non-vectorization way and vectorization way
- apply1.R: use apply to vectorize code, applying the same function to rows/columns of a matrix
- apply2.R: use apply to define your own functions
- boilerplate.R: A boilerplate R script
- break.R: a control flow tool, break, is useful to break out of loops when some condition is met
- browse.R: use browser() to debug script, inserting a breakpoint in code and then stepping throuth code
- control_flow.R: control flow tools in R including if, then, else and for and while loops
- next.R: a control flow tool, next, is used to skip to next iteration of a loop
- preallocate.R: an example shows pre-allocate a vector can make results faster
- sample.R: an example of vectorization involving lapply and sapply
- try.R: use try keyword to catch the error and keep going instead of having R throw you out

### Data
- EcolArchives-E089-51-D1.csv: import file of PP_Dists.R and PP_Regress.R
- PoundHillData.csv: import file of DataWrang.R and DataWrangTidy.R
- PoundHillMetaData.csv: import file of DataWrang.R and DataWrangTidy.R

### Result
An empty directory as origin version only with a .gitignore.
