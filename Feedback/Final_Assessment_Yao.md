# Final CMEE Bootcamp Assessment: Yao

- The repository structure was generally well-organized with weekly directories and a main README file.
- README.md files improved over the weeks, including detailed descriptions of scripts, dependencies, and usage.
- `.gitignore` - You could have done with more exclusions specific to certain weeks (remember that you can include/exclude subdirectories/files/patterns). You may [find this useful](https://www.gitignore.io).
- Some files (e.g., unnecessary outputs) were committed unnecessarily, increasing the repository size.

##  Week 1

 Scripts were simple and demonstrated clear objectives (e.g., `ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh` and `csvtospace.sh`). 
  - Minor errors in ha`ndling inputs in shell scripts were corrected in later weeks.
  - The lack of script-level comments and comprehensive test cases was noted.

## Week 2

- Missing docstrings in some scripts reduced readability.

## Week 3

- Some scripts had errors due to missing datasets.
- Florida Practical code demonstrated correct permutation method to analyze  the  temperature data. Visualizations were informative but could benefit from additional annotations.
- The LaTeX report was well-structured but included minor grammatical errors. It provided a concise summary of the analysis, but including a discussion of the significance of the observed correlation would improve the scientific narrative. Figures were formatted well, but a better caption for each would have helped.
- The Autocorrelation practical was fine -- the code  was reasonably efficient , whilst providing a correct answer to the question. The  provided statistical and biological/ecological interpretations in the report could have been stronger; has a somewhat weak conclusion at the end.

- Your Groupwork practicals were all in order, and your group did well in collaborating on it based on the commit/merge/pull history. Check the groupwork feedback pushed to your group repo for more details.   


## Git Practices

- Commits were frequent but sometimes lacked descriptive messages.
- The repository size (2.89 MiB by Week 4) was acceptable but included unnecessary binaries, which could be excluded.

## Overall Assessment

Overall, a good job. 

Commenting could be improved -- you are currently erring on the side of overly verbose comments at times (including in your readmes), which is nonetheless better than not commenting at all, or too little! This will improve with experience, as you will begin to get a feel of what is ``common-knowledge'' among programmers, and what stylistic idioms are your own and require explanation. In general though, comments should be written to help explain a coding or syntactical decision to a user (or to your future self re-reading the code!) rather than to describe the meaning of a symbol, argument or function (that should be in the function docstring in Python for example).

It was a tough set of weeks, but I believe your hard work in them has given you a great start towards further training, a quantitative masters dissertation, and ultimately a career in quantitative biology!
